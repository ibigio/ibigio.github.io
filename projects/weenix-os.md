During my time working on the Weenix OS project, I developed a Unix-like operating system, adding 3,500 lines of code to an existing 30,000-line codebase. This comprehensive, semester-long project involved tackling complex kernel modules for various components such as processes, threads, device drivers, a virtual filesystem, S5FS, and virtual memory management. I am now a certified GDB pro.

Navigating and understanding the complexity of the codebase was a significant challenge, but I was able to effectively manage it through proper documentation and commenting practices. This well-documented code proved to be extremely beneficial, especially when I had to take a one-year break halfway through the project. Upon resuming, I was able to easily pick up where I left off and continue working on the project without any major setbacks.

This project greatly enhanced my low-level programming skills and understanding of operating systems while showcasing my ability to tackle complex, long-term projects.
