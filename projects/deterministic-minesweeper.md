Deterministic Minesweeper is a unique version of the classic game that only generates maps that can be solved without guessing, providing a more enjoyable and strategic experience for players. Initially inspired by a friend's frustration with the necessity of guessing in traditional Minesweeper, the project's focus shifted to generating solvable boards. The realization that using kernels and convolutions, typically associated with image processing, could be applied to efficiently process empty and taken slots on the game board, led to the development of an innovative and effective solver. The game is developed using Python and JavaScript, with Heroku, SciPy, and p5.js as essential tools. You can find the source code on GitHub (https://github.com/ibigio/minesweeper_rough_draft) and even play a live version of the game at https://better-minesweeper-draft.herokuapp.com/. Enjoy a more satisfying and challenging Minesweeper experience with Deterministic Minesweeper!
