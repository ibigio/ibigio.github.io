The Course Registration Tool serves as a convenient SMS-based service that allows students to request notifications when a spot becomes available in a capped class. Initially developed using Bash during my freshman year at Brown, I later re-implemented it twice in Python, integrating Twilio and Heroku. This updated version streamlined the code, added features such as texting and public usage, and addressed deprecated endpoints. The tool's most recent iteration allows students to simply text a course code to a designated phone number, and the requests are then managed by Twilio and Heroku. Once a spot opens up in the desired class, students receive a prompt text message, eliminating the need for constant manual checking. The Course Registration Tool showcases my proficiency in Python and Bash, as well as my ability to effectively use tools such as Heroku and Twilio.
