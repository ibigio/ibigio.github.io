<p>I created this course registration tool to notify me when someone drops a capped class so I could immediately register for it, saving me the burden of continous checking by hand. The most recent version of this tool allows Brown students to text a course code to a specific phone number using traditional SMS. Then, I use Twilio and Heroku to handle the requests, confirming that the course is being monitored, and eventually sending a text as soon as a spot opens up.</p>
<p>I first created this tool freshamn year using Bash, and re-implemented twice after in Python, integrating Twilio and Heroku. Each iteartion cleaned up code, simplified logic, added features such as texting and public usage, or fixed access to deprecated endpoints.</p>
<h2>First Iteration: Bash</h2>
<p>During my first semester at Brown, while registering for classes, I realized some of the courses I wanted to take had an enrollment cap. If you did not get an override code from the professor, the only way to get in was waiting for someone to drop it (which did happen occasionally as students tried to figure out their schdules), and racing to be the first one to register for that spot. After refreshing the registration page every five minutes for an hour, I decided there had to be a better way.</p>
<p>At that time the only computer science experience I had was playing around with OS X's terminal, so I decided to use Bash (since it was the only language I knew). I knew little about browsers and network requets, but knew there had to be some way to replicate my actions on the browser just using the command line. Some Googling led me to a Firefox plugin that let me see all packets sent, with which by sheer luck I stumbled upon a URL most requests were going to. It turned out all course registration information was stored as a huge JSON at this public URL. Jackpot.</p>
<p>Except I did not know know about JSON at the time. So I iterated over the string in a Bash for loop, looking for a specific sequence representing the course's ID. It took 4 minutes to run. Never again.</p>
<p>While absurdly slow, it technially worked. (Actually, the first time it worked I was testing it with a multivariable calculus class, which just happened to have a slot open up during my testing.)</p>
