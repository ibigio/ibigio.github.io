During my time away from the US, I found it challenging to receive 2FA texts for various online services. To resolve this issue, I developed a Text to Messenger Tool that forwards SMS messages to my Messenger account. The tool was built using JavaScript and integrated with Heroku, Express, Twilio, and the Messenger API.

To set up the tool, I had to create a Facebook Business account and configure the necessary webhooks to ensure proper communication between the services. The final product proved to be quite useful, as I was able to successfully test it during my stay in Colombia. This allowed me to maintain secure access to my accounts and receive timely notifications without the need for a US-based phone number.
