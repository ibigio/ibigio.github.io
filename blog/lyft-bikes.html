      <h1>Reverse engineering Lyft bikes for fun (and profit)</h1>
      <time datetime="2026-01-15">January 2026</time>

    <p>This is the <strong>opening paragraph</strong> with some <em>italic text</em> and a <a href="https://example.com">link to somewhere</a>. It sets the stage for what's to come.</p>

    <h2>The Discovery</h2>

    <p>I was curious about how Lyft's bike-sharing system worked under the hood. What started as idle curiosity turned into a deep dive into their API.</p>

    <p>Here's what I found when I started poking around:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The bikes communicate over cellular networks</li>
      <li>Each bike has a unique identifier</li>
      <li>The API is surprisingly <em>well-documented</em> (internally)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technical Deep Dive</h2>

    <p>The first thing I did was inspect the network traffic. You can do this with a simple <code>curl</code> command:</p>

    <pre><code>curl -X GET "https://api.example.com/bikes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"</code></pre>

    <p>The response looked something like this:</p>

    <pre><code>{
  "bikes": [
    {
      "id": "bike_abc123",
      "lat": 37.7749,
      "lng": -122.4194,
      "battery": 87,
      "status": "available"
    }
  ],
  "total": 1542
}</code></pre>

    <h3>Parsing the Data</h3>

    <p>I wrote a simple Python script to parse this:</p>

    <pre><code>import requests
import json

def get_available_bikes(lat, lng, radius=500):
    """Fetch all available bikes within a radius."""
    response = requests.get(
        f"https://api.example.com/bikes",
        params={"lat": lat, "lng": lng, "radius": radius}
    )
    return response.json()["bikes"]

# Find bikes near Dolores Park
bikes = get_available_bikes(37.7596, -122.4269)
print(f"Found {len(bikes)} bikes nearby")</code></pre>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Always check for rate limiting</li>
      <li>APIs often expose more than intended</li>
      <li>Documentation is sometimes hidden in plain sight</li>
    </ol>

    <blockquote>
      <p>"The best way to understand a system is to try to break it." — Someone, probably</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>A Note on Ethics</h3>

    <p>I want to be clear: I didn't do anything <strong>malicious</strong> with this information. The goal was purely educational. If you're doing similar research:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Don't abuse rate limits</li>
      <li>Don't access data you shouldn't</li>
      <li>Report vulnerabilities responsibly</li>
    </ul>
